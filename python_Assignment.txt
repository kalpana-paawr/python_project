What is the difference between / and // operators in Python?

How do you calculate the power of a number in Python?
(Hint: Use ** or pow())

Take an input value from the user for a and check whether it is between 10,000 and 50,000.

Take input from the user and check whether the value is even or odd using a ternary operator.

Take input from the user for variables a, b, and c. Find out the maximum value among the three and print it.

Given the expression result = 10 + 20 * 30 / 5 ** 2, what will the value of the result be?
Explain the order of operations.

Given the expression a < b == c < d, what is happening here?
Explain with an example:

python
Copy
Edit
a, b, c, d = 1, 2, 2, 3
print(a < b == c < d)  # Test this code
What is the output of the following code?

python
Copy
Edit
a = b = c = []
a.append(1)
print(b)  # Output?
What is the output of the following code?

python
Copy
Edit
a = "hello"
b = "hello"
c = []
d = []
print(a is b)  # Output?
print(c is d)  # Output?
Why do a is b and c is d give different results?

Given the expression result = (False and True) or (True and False) or (True or False), what will the result be?
Explain how Python evaluates this.

Write a Python expression using the ternary operator to find the maximum of three variables a, b, and c, without using the max() function.

How do you convert a string to a list and a list to a string in Python?
Example:

Convert ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'] to "hello".
Convert "hello" to ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'].
What is the difference between == and is operators when comparing two objects in Python?

You have a list containing different data types:

python
Copy
Edit
data = [1, "two", 3.0, [4, 5], {"five": 5}, (6,)]
Write a Python function that processes this list and outputs:

The sum of all integers and floats.
The concatenation of all strings.
The total number of elements in all sequences (lists, tuples, dictionaries).
You are given a list of numbers. Write a Python function using a for loop to find the first even number greater than 50. If no such number exists, return None.
Example:

python
Copy
Edit
nums = [10, 47, 53, 60, 33]
# Output: 60
Write Python code to calculate the factorial of a number using a while loop.
